# Overview

This is a Sign game. 
Players join a room. One of them is cather and one of them is holding a flag.
To give a flag to someone else - a player should draw a sign of a player they want to give it to. 
And to receive a flag a player should draw a sign of a flag holder.

Cacher can not see a flag. They can only guess a sign of a player who's holding a flag.
